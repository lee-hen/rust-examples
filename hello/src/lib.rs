        // by a Mutex cannot be accessed unless we hold the lock.
        // But this implementation can also result in the lock being held longer than intended if we donâ€™t
        // think carefully about the lifetime of the MutexGuard<T>.
        // Because the values in the while expression remain in scope for the duration of the block, the lock
